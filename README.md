🎮 Concept of a Number Guessing Game 🎮

   The Number Guessing Game is a simple yet entertaining game where a player attempts to guess a number selected by the computer. This game is usually played in a range of numbers (e.g., between 1️⃣ and 100️⃣). The computer gives feedback after each guess—telling the player if their guess was too low ⬇️, too high ⬆️, or correct ✅.

Game Flow 🌀 (High-Level View):

🖥️ Computer Chooses a Secret Number:

   The computer randomly selects a secret number within a predefined range (like between 1️⃣ and 100️⃣). 🎲

👤 Player Makes a Guess:

   The player enters their guess, attempting to find the secret number. 🤔

💬 Feedback Given:

   After each guess, the computer provides feedback:
   Too Low ⬇️: "Your guess is too low. Try again."
   Too High ⬆️: "Your guess is too high. Try again."
Correct! 🎉: "Congratulations! You guessed the right number!"

🔄 Repeat Until Correct:
   
   The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. 🔁

🏁 End the Game:

   Once the correct number is guessed, the game ends, and the player is informed of how many attempts it took them to guess the number. 🎯🎉

Core Features in the Game 🔧:

🔢 Random Number Generation:
   The computer uses a random number generator to pick a number from a given range (e.g., 1️⃣ to 100️⃣). This ensures that the number is unpredictable. 🎲

⌨️ User Input:

   The player inputs their guesses via the keyboard. The game checks whether the input is a valid number and provides the appropriate feedback. 💻

🔄 Loops:
   
   The game continues to prompt the player for guesses until the correct number is found. This is handled by a loop that keeps running until the condition for winning is met. 🔁

⚖️ Conditional Statements:
   
   The game uses if statements to compare the player's guess with the secret number and provide feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. 💡

Why This Is a Classic Beginner-Level Game 🧑‍💻:

   This game is an excellent starting project for beginners because it introduces important programming concepts such as:
   📊 Variables (storing the secret number, guesses, and attempts)
   🔁 Loops (to repeat the guessing process)
   ⚖️ Conditionals (to provide feedback on guesses)
   ⌨️ Input/Output (interacting with the player via the console)
